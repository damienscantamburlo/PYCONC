Function - saveResults (Viewer.java) 

It takes a string as an input by which you can save the appropriate image, means you can directly save the stress, load, deformed images
without explicitly going to each view, it makes a drawing canvas by itself.


The value of loadsteps in the fucntion createModel() in Launcher.java has been changed from 20 to 2.

*********

I am passing the viewer class as a parameter when it creates the jconc object because then only we can have a pointer to the inital object of viewer where we can reload the new changed model. This is not a very good idea, but a workable way which is yet to be decided.

the following changes will be made :

passing Viewer's object to Jconc then passing the Jconc object to ModelWriter.

Its not working, ultimate saviour is java threads. If this doesn't work then its trouble.
